- 👋 Hi, I’m Riley Fischer!
- 👀 I’m interested in computer programming, and more specifically graphical applications, and C.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to program in C and C++ the hard way, but throwing yourself into something you know you can't do.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate!
- 📫 How to reach me... rfmineguy@gmail.com.
